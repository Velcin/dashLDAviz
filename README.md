# dashLDAviz

This is a visualization tool for LDA model using DASH.

The full list of packages is normally listed in the requirements file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Of course, you need to install Jupyter notebook / lab before.

It seems there is something broken with dash when installing with pip (see https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/1992). The same with graphviz that comes with the neato binary. I solved these problems by installing the packages with conda directly.
